# The Homebrew Launcher

#### Presentation

This for of masher's is just for my own personal use

#### Usage

To use the grid launcher as your homebrew menu, simply rename the 3dsx executable to boot.3dsx and place it at the root of your SD card.

Select the "?" icon in the top right corner of the launcher to view help pages. Press START in hbmenu to reboot your console into home menu. Use the D-PAD, CIRCLE-PAD or the touchscreen to select an application, and press A or touch it again to start it.
